# React + Vite

This is a practice filesystem problem via Deepseek. Their problem was to create a nested to-do list.
This involved:
- Reading and importing a JSON file
- Getting the regular elements and the nested elements
- Using the map function from React
- Remembering the React Syntax
- Making code for CSS that is already there
